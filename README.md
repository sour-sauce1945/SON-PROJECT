# Titration Calculator

This Python script is a Titration Calculator that allows you to perform acid-base titrations and calculate the pH at various points during the titration process. It's a useful tool for chemistry students and professionals to understand how the pH of a solution changes as an acid or base is added.

## Features

- Perform acid-base titrations with ease.
- Calculate pH at different stages of the titration.
- Visualize the gradual pH change with a plot.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Run the `titration_calculator.py` script using a Python interpreter.

3. Choose one of the following options:
    - **Base Titrant (Titration of Acid)**
    - **Acid Titrant (Titration of Base)**
    - **Acid Mixture**
    - **Base Mixture**

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the required information, such as volumes and concentrations of the titrant and analyte.

5. The program will calculate and display the pH at each point in the titration process.

6. For acid-base mixtures, the program will directly calculate and display the pH.

7. The program will generate a plot showing the gradual change in pH throughout the titration process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib library

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
